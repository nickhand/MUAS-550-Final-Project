# Yelp Ratings and Food Safety Inspections

by Rashon Clark


## Introduction
This project explores the relationship between Yelp restaurant ratings and food safety inspections from the Philadelphia Department of Health. We will interrogate the notion that customer satisfaction is really correlated with good sanitation practices, and if customers have any awareness of such problems. Yelp was chosen because of the availability of data and its longevity in the ratings sector, as well as its role as one of the broadest and widely used restaurant rating systems. Not only is it widely used by eaters, many establishments actively work to ensure positive ratings on the site. Similarly, the Department of Health is authority to which every food establishment is subject and with consistent standards.
